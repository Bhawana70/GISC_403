Check out this map that means a lot to me. It's got a few special spots in Christchurch that are like pieces of my own story.

Bottle Lake Forest Park is my go-to place when I need to relax. Riding my bike through the trails here helps me clear my head and enjoy the quiet.

Riccarton House and Bush feel like a step back in time. It's where I go to think and soak in a bit of history among the old trees and buildings.

Travis Wetland is where I love to start my days. It's right in the city, but with all the birds singing, it feels like its own peaceful world.

New Brighton Pier is where I love to watch the sky change color at sunset. There's something special about hanging out by the water.

The big shape on the map wraps around places that are full of memories from growing up. Every corner around here reminds me of a different story from when I was younger.

This map is more than just directions-it's a collection of the times and places that mean a lot to me. I hope you enjoy seeing them as much as I do.
